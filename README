Overview
========

LoginKit is an attempt to implement a compatible, yet standalone alternative to
logind and libsystemd-login (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd),
which does not depend on a specific init system.

It acts as a glue layer that exposes logind's interface, but uses ConsoleKit
(https://github.com/ConsoleKit2/ConsoleKit2) as a backend.

It's under heavy development and not ready for general use.

Usage
=====

* compile
* kill logind
* run loginkitd
* export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)
* run GDM
