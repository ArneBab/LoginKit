Overview
========

LoginKit is an attempt to implement a compatible, yet standalone alternative to
logind and libsystemd (http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd), which
does not depend on a specific init system.

It acts as a glue layer that exposes logind's interface, but uses ConsoleKit2
(https://github.com/ConsoleKit2/ConsoleKit2) as a backend.

It's under heavy development and not ready for general use.

Dependencies
============

LoginKit requires GLib, PAM and ConsoleKit2.

Building
========

On Debian, install libpam0g-dev and libglib2.0-dev.

To build LoginKit:
  make

Usage
=====

  - Kill systemd-logind
  - Run loginkitd (quickly, before logind is restarted)
  - Replace systemd's libsystemd.so.0 with LoginKit's one
  - Add pam_loginkit.so to PAM's modules directory
  - Replace "pam_systemd" with "pam_loginkit", in PAM's configuration
